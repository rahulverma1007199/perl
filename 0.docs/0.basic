Perl is one of the top choices for text processing, system administration and even web development.

to run perl through command line interface. "perl -e 'print "hello\n"'" -- you can also use double quote but it is used to interpolate variables.

you can also run with -E - it enables some of the core features --like using "say" -- this automatically add a new line of whatever we are printing
"perl -E 'say "hello"'"
"perl -E 'while(<>) {say uc $_}' " -- some use cases of this is -- listing files, parsing file names, replacing file extensions.
