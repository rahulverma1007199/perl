Go to MetaCpan
search -- Try::Tiny::SmartCatch another is Exception::Class

use both 

try sub{

},
catch_default sub{
    say "$_";
};

to throw Exception -- use Exception::Class('MyException');

in try block -- MyException->throw(error => 'something in not right');

you can also add catch_when block between try and catch_default ;

like - catch_when 'MyException' => sub {
    say 'I know'; or you can add $_ -- this print the error
}

why to use -- beacuse die combine with eval is not a good way for larger projects
